# What is First ML?
First ML is a Notebook that is designed to help people who are new to machine learning learn and use a simple Multi-layer Perceptron regressor model. 

The Multi-layer Perceptron model used in this Notebook is built from the sklearn.mlpregressor module.

## Before starting
Make sure that all the necessary modules mentioned in the [requirements section](Requirements) are installed properly before continuing further.

It is also expected that you have already 'cleaned' your training data properly.
